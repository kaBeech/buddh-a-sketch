A fun art toy or relaxing metitation tool, depending on your perspective =)

This started as an emulation of a classic drawing toy and evolved to include
functionality for meditative practice. Then I added ever-mutating neon black
colors because fun! Wave your mouse over the grid, click all the buttons, see
what they do! I hope you enjoy it =)

To-Do:

- Add functionality for touchscreen devices
