A fun art toy or relaxing metitation tool, depending on your perspective =)

### Basic info

This started as an emulation of a classic drawing toy and evolved to include
functionality for meditative practice. Then I added ever-mutating neon black
colors because fun!

This is one of my first JavaScript projects, and still one of my favorites. It's
not very sophisticated, but it's a lot of fun and I love it!

### Instructions

Wave your mouse over the grid, click all the buttons, see what they do! I hope
you enjoy it =)

### ToDo

- Add functionality for touchscreen devices
