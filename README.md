# etchpad

This started as an emulation of a classic drawing toy and 
evolved to include functionality for meditative practice. 
Then I added ever-mutating neon black colors because fun! 
Wave your mouse over the grid, click all the buttons, see 
what they do! I hope you enjoy it =)

To-Do:

-Add functionality for touchscreen devices
